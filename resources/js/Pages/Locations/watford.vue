        <template v-slot:title5>Repair or Replace: Making the Right Tyre Choice</template>
        <template v-slot:content5>
            <p>
                Deciding whether to repair or replace a tyre depends on the nature and extent of the damage. Minor punctures can often be repaired, but significant damage or wear may require a replacement for safety.
            </p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-6 mt-6">

                        Assessing Damage Severity
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Not all tyre damage is repairable. Minor punctures in the tread area can often be fixed, but damage to the sidewall necessitates a replacement due to safety concerns.
                </li>

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Punctures within the central tread area are usually repairable. However, damage near the shoulder or sidewall of the tyre is not safely repairable and requires a new tyre.
                </li>

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Only punctures less than 6mm in diameter can be safely repaired. Larger punctures compromise the tyre's integrity and necessitate replacement.

                    <br>
                    If your tyre is old or shows significant wear, replacing it might be more cost-effective and safer in the long run, even if the damage is minor.

                    Tyres with multiple punctures, especially close together, should be replaced to ensure safety and performance.
