        <template v-slot:title5>Should I repair or replace my tyre?</template>
        <template v-slot:content5>
            <p>
                The decision to repair or replace a tyre depends on the type and extent of the damage.
                Minor punctures can often be repaired, but damage to the sidewall or larger punctures usually require replacement.
                Age and wear of the tyre should also be considered when making the decision.
            </p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-6 mt-6">
                <li>

                        Assessing the Damage
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Not all tyre damage is created equal. Minor punctures in the tread can often be repaired, but certain types of damage—such as cuts,
                    cracks, or bulges on the sidewall—require a replacement. The sidewall is a critical structural part of the tyre, and damage there is not safe to repair.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-lg">
                        Location of the Damage
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    The location of the puncture plays a big role in determining if the tyre can be repaired.
                    Generally, punctures located in the central three-quarters of the tread area are repairable.
                    However, punctures on the edge of the tread or on the sidewall cannot be safely repaired and should be replaced to prevent blowouts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-lg">
                        Size of the Puncture
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Tyre repairs are only effective for punctures that are 6mm or smaller in diameter.
                    Any damage larger than this typically compromises the tyre’s structural integrity,
                    making it unsafe for future use. In such cases, replacing the tyre is the safest option.
                </li>

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Even if a tyre puncture seems repairable, its age and overall wear should be considered.
                    Tyres that are older than 5-6 years, or those with significant tread wear, may not provide the same safety and performance,
                    even after a repair. If the tyre is close to its legal minimum tread depth (1.6mm in the UK), it's often better to opt for a replacement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-lg">
                        Multiple Punctures
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    If your tyre has multiple punctures, especially in close proximity, a replacement is usually recommended.
                    Repairing multiple areas can weaken the tyre’s structure, reducing its overall strength and safety.

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    While a tyre repair can save you money, it’s only effective if the tyre is in otherwise good condition.
                    Replacing the tyre is a better option if it’s nearing the end of its lifespan, heavily worn,
                    or showing other signs of damage. After all, your safety on the road should always come first.
