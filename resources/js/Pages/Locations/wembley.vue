        <template v-slot:title5>Repair or Replace: Making the Right Tyre Choice</template>
        <template v-slot:content5>
            <p>
                The decision to repair or replace a tyre depends on the type and extent of the damage. Minor punctures can often be repaired, but damage to the sidewall or larger punctures usually require replacement. Age and wear of the tyre should also be considered when making the decision.
            </p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-6 mt-6">
                <li>

                        Assessing Damage Severity
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Not all tyre damage is repairable. Minor punctures in the tread area can often be fixed, but damage to the sidewall necessitates a replacement due to safety concerns.
                </li>

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Punctures within the central tread area are usually repairable. However, damage near the shoulder or sidewall of the tyre is not safely repairable and requires a new tyre.
                </li>

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Only punctures less than 6mm in diameter can be safely repaired. Larger punctures compromise the tyre's integrity and necessitate replacement.

                    <br>
                    If your tyre is old or shows significant wear, replacing it might be more cost-effective and safer in the long run, even if the damage is minor.

                    Tyres with multiple punctures, especially close together, should be replaced to ensure safety and performance.
