            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">1. Rotate Your Tyres</h3>

            <p>
                Tyre rotation is one of the most effective ways to extend the life of your tyres. Front and rear tyres wear differently due to the various loads and forces they experience. By rotating your tyres, you help ensure they wear more evenly over time, which can significantly extend their lifespan.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s how to manage tyre rotation:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Rotate your tyres every 6,000 to 8,000 miles</span>
                    or as recommended by your vehicle manufacturer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rotate them in a pattern that ensures even wear across all four tyres (such as moving the rear tyres to the front and switching the front tyres diagonally to the back).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Regular tyre rotation helps prevent uneven wear and maximizes the life of your tyres, saving you money in the long run.
            </p>


            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">2. Monitor Tread Depth</h3>

            <p>
                Your tyre's tread depth is critical to maintaining traction on the road, especially in wet conditions. As the tread wears down, your tyres lose their ability to grip the road effectively, which can lead to hydroplaning and poor handling. It’s important to check your tread depth regularly to ensure it’s within the safe range.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can easily check tread depth using:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">The penny test:</span>
                    Insert a penny into the tread groove with Lincoln’s head facing down. If you can see the top of his head, your tread depth is less than 2/32 of an inch, and it’s time to replace the tyres.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Tread depth gauge:</span>
                    A more precise tool that allows you to measure the exact depth of your tread.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In most places, the legal minimum tread depth is 1.6mm, but many experts recommend replacing your tyres when they reach 3mm for better safety and performance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">3. Balance and Align Your Tyres</h3>

            <p>
                Tyre balancing and alignment are crucial to maintaining even tyre wear and ensuring a smooth ride. Misaligned or unbalanced tyres can cause uneven wear, reduce fuel efficiency, and make your car harder to handle.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Wheel alignment:</span>
                    If your vehicle pulls to one side or your steering wheel vibrates, it may be time to have your wheels aligned. Alignment ensures that your tyres make full contact with the road, reducing wear and improving handling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Tyre balancing:</span>
                    Imbalanced tyres cause uneven wear and vibrations. Have your tyres balanced every time you rotate them or notice any unusual vibrations while driving.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Regular alignment and balancing keep your tyres in good condition and improve your overall driving experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">4. Check Tyre Pressure Regularly</h3>

                    and before long trips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual or the sticker inside the driver’s door for the recommended pressure level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a reliable tyre pressure gauge to check the pressure, and make adjustments as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remember that tyre pressure fluctuates with temperature, so check it more frequently during temperature changes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">5. Inspect for Damage Regularly</h3>

            <p>
                Your tyres are constantly in contact with the road, making them susceptible to damage from debris, potholes, and other hazards. Regularly inspecting your tyres can help you identify potential issues before they become serious problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s what to look for:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Cracks or bulges:</span>
