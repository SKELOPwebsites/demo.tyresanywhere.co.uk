                Keeping your wheels in optimal condition is key to ensuring your vehicle runs smoothly and safely.
                Two essential services that help maintain your wheels are <span class="font-medium">wheel balancing</span> and <span class="font-medium">wheel alignment</span>.
                While both are crucial for your vehicle’s performance and tyre health, they serve different purposes.
                In this blog post, we’ll break down the differences between wheel balancing and wheel alignment, and why you need both to keep your vehicle in top shape.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What is Wheel Balancing?</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="font-medium">Wheel balancing</span> involves ensuring that the weight of the tyre and wheel assembly is evenly distributed around the axle.
                Even the slightest imbalance in weight can cause vibrations at higher speeds, uneven tyre wear, and discomfort while driving.
                This process is essential for providing a smooth ride and prolonging tyre life.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">How Does Wheel Balancing Work?</h3>

            <p>
                During a wheel balancing service, the technician will:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Remove the wheels and place them on a machine that measures the imbalance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add small weights to the rim of the wheel to balance it out, ensuring even weight distribution across the wheel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reinstall the wheels and perform a test to ensure the vibration is eliminated.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Signs You Need Wheel Balancing:</h3>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Vibrations in the steering wheel, seat, or floorboard when driving at higher speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uneven or premature tyre wear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A noticeable drop in fuel efficiency.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What is Wheel Alignment?</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="font-medium">Wheel alignment</span> (also known as tracking) involves adjusting the angles of the wheels so they are set to the manufacturer’s specifications.
                Proper alignment ensures that the tyres meet the road at the correct angle, providing even contact and better handling.
                Alignment affects the vehicle’s <span class="font-medium">camber</span>, <span class="font-medium">toe</span>, and <span class="font-medium">caster</span>
                — three key angles that control how the tyres touch the road.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">How Does Wheel Alignment Work?</h3>

            <p>
                When performing a wheel alignment, a technician adjusts the following:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Camber:</span>
                    The angle of the tyre when viewed from the front of the vehicle. If the top of the tyre tilts in or out, the camber is out of alignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Toe:</span>
                    The angle of the tyres when viewed from above. If the tyres point inward or outward, they are misaligned in the toe position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Caster:</span>
                    The angle of the steering axis when viewed from the side of the vehicle. Incorrect caster can affect the vehicle’s steering stability.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Signs You Need Wheel Alignment:</h3>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How Often Should You Get Wheel Balancing and Alignment?</h3>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Wheel Balancing:</span>
                    It’s recommended to get your wheels balanced every <span class="font-medium">5,000 to 6,000 miles</span> or when you notice any vibrations while driving.
                    Balancing is also required after getting new tyres, rotating your tyres, or repairing a flat tyre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Wheel Alignment:</span>
                    Wheel alignment should be checked at least once a year, but you should get it done sooner if you notice any signs of misalignment,
                    such as uneven tyre wear or your car pulling to one side. It’s also wise to get your alignment checked after hitting a pothole or curb,
                    as these can knock your wheels out of alignment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Can You Have One Without the Other?</h3>

            <p>
                While wheel balancing and alignment are separate services, they often go hand-in-hand. Imbalanced wheels can cause alignment issues,
                and misaligned wheels can lead to further imbalances in weight distribution. For optimal performance,
                it’s best to ensure that both your wheels are balanced and aligned.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Final Thoughts</h3>

            <p>
                Both wheel balancing and wheel alignment are crucial for maintaining the health of your tyres and the overall performance of your vehicle.
                While wheel balancing addresses uneven weight distribution that can cause vibrations,
                wheel alignment ensures that your tyres meet the road at the correct angles for optimal handling and safety.
            </p>

            <p>
                By understanding the differences between the two and ensuring both services are performed regularly, you can extend the life of your tyres,
                improve your vehicle’s fuel efficiency, and enjoy a smoother, safer ride.
