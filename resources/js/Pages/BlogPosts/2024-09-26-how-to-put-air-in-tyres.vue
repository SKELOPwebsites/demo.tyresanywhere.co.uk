                Keeping your tyres properly inflated is essential for vehicle safety, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.
                Under-inflated tyres can lead to poor handling, decreased mileage, and even tyre blowouts.
                Follow this simple guide to make sure your tyres are always at the correct pressure
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 1: Check the Recommended Tyre Pressure</h3>

            <p>
                Before you start inflating your tyres, you need to know the correct pressure. You can find the recommended tyre pressure in a few places:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Your Vehicle’s Manual:</span>
                    The manual will indicate the optimal tyre pressure for your specific vehicle model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Driver’s Side Door Jamb:</span>
                    Many cars have a sticker on the inside of the driver’s side door that lists the recommended pressure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Tyre Itself:</span>
                    Some tyres have the maximum PSI (pounds per square inch) listed on the sidewall, though this is not necessarily the recommended pressure for everyday driving.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Make sure to check whether the recommendation is different for the <span class="font-semibold">front and rear tyres</span>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 2: Prepare the Necessary Tools</h3>

            <p>To put air in your tyres, you'll need:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">A Tyre Pressure Gauge:</span>
                    This tool helps you measure the current air pressure in your tyres.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Air Compressor:</span>
                    You can find air compressors at most petrol stations, or you can purchase a portable one for home use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Valve Caps:</span>
                    Make sure your tyre valve caps are present before starting, as they help maintain pressure after inflation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 3: Check the Current Tyre Pressure</h3>

            <p>
                Before adding air, you need to check the current pressure to see how much air is required. Here’s how to do it:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Remove the <span class="font-medium">valve cap</span> from the tyre's valve stem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the <span class="font-medium">tyre pressure gauge</span> firmly on the valve stem to get a reading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compare the reading with the recommended pressure for your vehicle.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                If your tyre is under-inflated, proceed to the next step to add air.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 4: Add Air to Your Tyres</h3>

            <p>
                Now that you know the current pressure, it’s time to add air:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Attach the air compressor nozzle to the <span class="font-medium">valve stem</span>. You’ll hear a slight hissing sound as air moves into the tyre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inflate the tyre in <span class="font-medium">short bursts</span> to avoid over-inflation. Many air pumps have a built-in gauge, but if yours doesn’t, stop and check with your own pressure gauge frequently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Recheck the pressure</span> after each burst to ensure you don’t exceed the recommended PSI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the tyre reaches the recommended pressure, remove the air hose and quickly screw the <span class="font-medium">valve cap</span> back onto the tyre.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 5: Repeat for All Tyres</h3>

            <p>
                Repeat the process for all four tyres. Make sure to check each tyre’s pressure individually, as they may not all require the same amount of air.
                Don’t forget to also check your spare tyre—keeping it properly inflated is just as important in case of emergencies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 6: Double-Check for Leaks</h3>

            <p>
                After inflating all tyres, it's a good idea to check for any leaks. You can do this by:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Listening for a <span class="font-medium">hissing sound</span> around the valve or tyre surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applying a small amount of soapy water to the valve stem and tyre surface. If bubbles form, there may be a leak, and you should have the tyre inspected or repaired.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Step 7: Check Tyre Pressure Regularly</h3>

            <p>
                Tyre pressure fluctuates with temperature and general use, so it’s important to check your tyres <span class="font-medium">monthly</span> or before long trips.
                Keeping your tyres inflated to the recommended pressure ensures they wear evenly and last longer, saving you money on replacements.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Final Tips:</h3>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    Avoid over-inflating your tyres, as this can cause poor handling and increase the risk of blowouts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tyre pressure may decrease in cold weather, so check your tyres more frequently in winter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you don’t have access to a compressor at home, most petrol stations offer air pumps for a small fee or even for free.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why Proper Tyre Inflation Matters:</h3>

            <p>Maintaining the correct tyre pressure ensures:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Better Fuel Efficiency:</span> Under-inflated tyres can reduce fuel efficiency, leading to higher costs at the pump.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Longer Tyre Life:</span> Properly inflated tyres wear more evenly, extending their lifespan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Improved Safety:</span> Correct tyre pressure improves handling, reduces braking distance, and lowers the risk of tyre failure.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your tyres are always at the right pressure,
                improving your driving experience and keeping you safe on the road. Regular tyre maintenance is a small task that can save you from bigger issues down the line.
